# Fundamentals 5: HTTP Requests
by Renuka Bhusari

An **HTTP Request** is a message sent by a client to a server asking for a resource or for an action to be performed. HTTP requests and responses are how clients and servers communicate and interact. We'll cover the main types of requests: **GET**, **HEAD**, and **POST**. We'll also teach how to send requests using curl on the command line and the requests library in python!
