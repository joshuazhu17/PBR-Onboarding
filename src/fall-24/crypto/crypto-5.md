# Crypto 5: RSA
by Gary Song

RSA has a huge cultural signifigance for being the first pratical asymmetric cryptosystem, for which it was warded a turning award. For that reason, it is an important foundation for any aspiring cryptographer to study about. We cover the RSA cryptosystem, what it is, what calculations are needed, and a short proof on why it works. Later, we will discuss common attacks on the RSA cryptosystem
