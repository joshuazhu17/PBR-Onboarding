# Web 7: Catchup + Writeups
by Ronak Badhe and Stewart Kwok

Revisiting and completing unfinished challenges is an essential part of building your skills and deepening your understanding of key concepts. Today, we’ll take the opportunity to catch up on any unsolved challenges while exploring the elements of a strong writeup. A well-crafted writeup not only explains the challenge but also walks through your thought process, details the tools or techniques you used, and outlines the steps you took to reach a solution. It’s a valuable resource for both sharing knowledge with others and reflecting on your own learning journey.
