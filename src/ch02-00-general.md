# General CTF resources and tools

This chapter contains resources that train you for CTFs in general. These include past CTFs, general tools that you might use during a CTF, and other things too broad to fit into one category. For category-specific tools and resources, make sure to check out the appropriate chapters!

## General resources

### picoCTF

picoCTF is a CTF competition run by people at Carnegie Mellon University. Their website also contains resources for getting into CTFs, as well as previous years' competitions that you can tackle. Highly recommended for beginners.

### Cyber FastTrack and CyberStart

Possibly the most beginner friendly cybersecurity resource on this list. Some of the skills learned here are too basic to show up on CTFs, but they're still worth learning. Contact a team captain to join the PBR group on CyberStart.

## Tools

### pwntools

A Python library that helps with writing CTF scripts. You'll be using this a lot.

**Installing Pwntools on M1 Macs.**
A common installation problem with pwntools on M1 Macs is because `capstone`, a dependency of pwntools, fails to build. The fix for this is the following.

```shell
brew install cmake
pip install pwntools
```
