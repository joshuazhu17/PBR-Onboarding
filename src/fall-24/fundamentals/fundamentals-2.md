# Fundamentals 2: Forensics
by Alec Machlis

At a very high level, Forensics is the science of extracting and preserving data from things. In a crime lab, this is extracting clues from physical evidence from a crime scene, but in Cybersecurity, this is the collection of data from various digital sources. Forensics can be applied to a wide variety of fields in Computer Science, but we will primarily focus on File Forensics, with some cursory Image Steganography and Network Forensics introductions.
