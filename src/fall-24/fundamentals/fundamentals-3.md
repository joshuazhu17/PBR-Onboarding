# Fundamentals 3: Open Source Rev
by Mark Epstein

You will (probably) spend more time reading code in your life than writing it. That being the case, the ability to figure out what it's doing, or reverse engineer it, is extremely important regardless of whether you stay in cybersecurity or move on to regular software engineering. Often when dealing with reverse engineering in cybersecurity, it's helpful to have a good understanding of how data is represented in memory. That will be our primary focus alongside a little more high level reverse engineering.

## Challenges
We will be doing challenges rev/Character Numbers, rev/just-dance, and rev/brick-maze, available on our platform: [https://platform.acmcyber.com](https://platform.acmcyber.com). 

There are more challenges available there if you'd like to try them out.

## Resources
A lot of open source reverse engineering is just getting used to reading code. Just find a project on Github that seems interesting and start reading!
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/): An online tool that has a variety of different encoding and encryption schemes. This may be useful!
