# Psi Beta Rho Wiki
*by members of [Psi Beta Rho](https://pbr.acmcyber.com/) & [ACM Cyber at UCLA](https://www.acmcyber.com/)*

This wiki is a ongoing project run by Psi Beta Rho and ACM Cyber at UCLA. It is a collection of resources for learning about cybersecurity, particularly through CTFs. This is meant as both a starting point for beginners and a reference for more experienced players. While the content is primarily aimed at UCLA students who are part of the PBR team, it is also accessible to anyone who is interested in learning about cybersecurity.
